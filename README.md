## by Olaoluwa Idowu

# Model summary
> The model used is catboost model

> AUC score is 0.733. Precision and recall were also considered

> The accuracy was compromised to ensure the model learns to recognise both labels. 
  Increasing accuracy greatly affected the model's ability to recognise the 1 class as accuracy 
  does not truly show how the model is doing for a classification problem
